# Portfolio page

This is a portfolio page used to showcase my projects and knowlege.

## Technologies

- React & Vite

  Im using React with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) compiler for this page. I opted for React instead of Next.js since this is going to be a very lightweight side and doesn't have the need for server-side rendering.

- Tailwind & Daisy UI

  For styling and a component librairy I'm using [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) to leverage their built in support for themes and pre-built components.

## Run the page

To compile the page on your local machine run the following comands after cloning the repository from GitHub

```bash
npm install

```
